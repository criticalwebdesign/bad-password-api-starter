# Bad Password API

This project (based on Glitch's `glitch-hello-node`) appears in Critical Web Design Chapter 9 "Data Tracking" and includes a Node.js server script and a web page that connects to it. The front-end page presents a form the visitor can use to submit data, sending the submitted value to the back-end API running on the server. The server returns info to the page based on the input.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript. This project uses the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework and explores basic templating with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).



## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site back-end, one to return the homepage and one to update with the submitted color. Each one sends data to a Handlebars template which builds these parameter values into the web page the visitor sees.

← `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.
